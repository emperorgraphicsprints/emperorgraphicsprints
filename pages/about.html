            <p style="text-align: justify">Online Petition takes the power of the internet to transform society and places it in the hands of ordinary people. With iPetitions, you don't have to be a technical whiz or corporate behemoth to get your voice heard. We give you the tools and community to create your own sophisticated online campaign. All you have to do is write a petition in support of your cause. We help you gather support from around the world.</p>

            <h3>Changing the world</h3>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">At Online Petition, we are committed to the idea that technology can change the world for the better. Around the world, technology is making a difference to lives. In developing countries, the internet is delivering health information to villages and equipping schools with virtual libraries. In dictatorships, web sites are spaces of freedom where dissidents evade the clutches of a repressive state. In America, the internet offers voters direct access to their political representatives and helps enforce corporate responsibility. With our tools, you can be part of this process of democratization.</p>

            <h3>What we offer</h3>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">We offer the physical space to host your petition, and we give you the tools to gather signatures, blog about your cause, and build a community around the issues that you care about. Our sophisticated tools have been tested on a number of online petitions, and offer a high degree of customization without requiring any programming or technical knowledge. You might find other petition sites out there. But none of them offers the full range of tools that we do. Among other things, our tools allow you to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Customize your question list</li>
                <li>Customize the design of your petition</li>
                <li>Download real-time data on your petition</li>
                <li>Blog about your petition</li>
                <li>Create filters to block out duplicate signatures</li>
                <li>And much more..</li>
            </ul>
